                <h1>About Marina</h1>
                <p>1) My name is <strong>Marina</strong>. I am originally from <abbr title = "Brazil">BR</abbr>, but I have been living in Canada since 2018. After working in the Finance industry for the past years, I realized that I would love to work in an environment where I could use creativity and design to help people and companies. So, in 2020 during the <abbr title = "SARS-CoV-2">Covid-19</abbr> pandemic, I became more interested in <em>UX design</em> and <em>Graphic Design</em> after taking a few online courses. Recently, I also became very interested in reading books that help me to create good new habits. </p>

                <p>I am a curious person who is constantly looking for answers. For this reason, I am always trying to motivate and encourage myself and those around me. I consider myself very organized and detail oriented as my background in finance demanded. Lately, I started to learn more about a few Design Software such as <strong>Illustrator</strong> and <strong>Photoshop</strong>.</p>
